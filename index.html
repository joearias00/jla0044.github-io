            <h3>Impact of Medical Marijuana Laws on Marijuana Usage by Age Groups: An Econometric Analysis</h3>
            <p>
                In April 2022, I programmed R to model the impact of Medical Marijuana Laws on marijuana usage across US age groups. I analyzed over 1000 data points, achieving robust results with 95% confidence. I utilized regression analysis to measure the statistical significance of the influence of Medical Marijuana Laws (MMLs) on marijuana usage rates, achieving a p-value of less than 0.001, indicating high confidence in the obtained results. I produced clear and concise visual representations, such as histograms and regression plots, to effectively communicate complex findings to both technical and non-technical audiences.

                In April 2022, I conducted a thorough financial analysis of NVDA Corporation by evaluating 5-year financial data from sources including Value Line, Yahoo Finance, and Morningstar. I performed a comprehensive financial analysis on NVDA, using diverse tools (beta, Du Pont, intrinsic value) to extract strategic insights for informed decisions. I analyzed NVDA's dividend policy and coverage, yielding a ratio above 2, demonstrating dividend sustainability. I translated findings into actionable insights for strategic dividend planning.
